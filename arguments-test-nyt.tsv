G01001	Could today’s version of America have been able to win World War II? It hardly seems possible.	in favor of	That victory required national cohesion, voluntary sacrifice for the common good and trust in institutions and each other. America’s response to Covid-19 suggests that we no longer have sufficient quantities of any of those things.
G01002	Instead of being largely beaten, this disease could linger, as a more manageable threat, for generations.	in favor of	This week my Times colleague Apoorva Mandavilli reported that experts now believe that America will not achieve herd immunity anytime soon.
G01003	This week my Times colleague Apoorva Mandavilli reported that experts now believe that America will not achieve herd immunity anytime soon.	in favor of	A major reason is that about 30 percent of the U.S. population is reluctant to get vaccinated.
G01004	That basic sense of peoplehood, of belonging to a common enterprise with a shared destiny, is exactly what’s lacking today.	in favor of	Researchers and reporters who talk to the vaccine-hesitant find that the levels of distrust, suspicion and alienation that have marred politics are now thwarting the vaccination process. They find people who doubt the competence of the medical establishment or any establishment, who assume as a matter of course that their fellow countrymen are out to con, deceive and harm them.
G01005	This “the only person you can trust is yourself” mentality has a tendency to cause people to conceive of themselves as individuals and not as citizens.	in favor of	Why should I take a risk on an experimental vaccine?
G01006	Why should I take a risk on an experimental vaccine?	in favor of	I’m not especially vulnerable. I may have already gotten the virus. If I get it in the future it won’t be that bad.
G01007	Most of the time distrust is earned distrust.	in favor of	Trust levels in any society tend to be reasonably accurate representations of how trustworthy that society has been.
G01008	The other thing to say is that once it is established, distrust tends to accelerate.	in favor of	If you distrust the people around you because you think they have bad values or are out to hurt you, then you are going to be slow to reach out to solve common problems. Your problems will have a tendency to get worse, which seems to justify and then magnify your distrust.
G01009	Vaccination is going relatively well in this country,	against	although the number of people who receive a dose each day is down from its peak.
G01010	Things could always get bad again, and the C.D.C. could always update its guidance and reintroduce more aggressive restrictions.	against	But right now, this moment feels to many like the beginning of the end of the pandemic.
G01011	But right now, this moment feels to many like the beginning of the end of the pandemic.	against	Still, even after the virus is brought under control it is still likely to have lingering effects.
G01012	This is quite significant	in favor of	because more than 30 million Americans have already been infected with the virus.
G01013	“No. It’s not so dangerous for us.”	in favor of	Neither of us wants to be the alarmist in the relationship, not when we are young and healthy and so far removed from harm’s way.
G01014	Besides, Shanghai is in good shape.	in favor of	Grocery stores are stocked, we are getting everything delivered without any issues, the hospitals are not crowded.
G01015	Our family and friends are all worried about us, urging us to return to the United States while we still can,	in favor of	to put an ocean between us and this sprawling epidemic.
G01016	Even if the situation in Shanghai becomes less comfortable, we are not helpless.	in favor of	We have a couple of boxes of masks, jugs of drinking water, potatoes and cabbages, instant noodles, cereal and a couple of frozen steaks.
G01017	When I really think about it, it makes no sense for me to be so laid back about this virulent new disease,	in favor of	especially since I have very little trust in the Chinese government, given its track record.
G01018	I managed to convince myself for a while that everything would be fine, but it was only a matter of time before something came along to shatter this illusion.	in favor of	Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio in the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has remained exactly 2.1 percent every day since Jan. 30.
G01019	No other developed country is doing so badly	in favor of	Graphs of the coronavirus curves in Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy look like mountains, with steep climbs up and then back down. The one for America shows a fast climb up to a plateau. For a while, the number of new cases in the U.S. was at least slowly declining. Now, according to The Times, it’s up a terrifying 22 percent over the last 14 days.
G01020	Republican political dysfunction has made a coherent campaign to fight the pandemic impossible.	in favor of	At the federal level as well as in many states, we’re seeing a combination of the blustering contempt for science that marks the conservative approach to climate change and the high tolerance for carnage that makes American gun culture unique.
G01021	The rot starts at the top.	in favor of	At the beginning of the crisis Trump acted as if he could wish the coronavirus away, and after an interval when he at least pretended to take it seriously, his administration has resumed a posture of blithe denial.
G01022	An epidemic that was once concentrated in blue states is increasingly raging in red ones.	in favor of	Now, as New York gingerly reopens, Arizona has become a hot spot — which isn’t stopping Trump from holding a rally at a Phoenix megachurch on Tuesday. Cases are also soaring in Texas, Florida and several other states.
G01023	When coronavirus cases started exploding on the East Coast in March, there were devastating failures by Democratic leaders.	in favor of	New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, not only forced nursing homes to take back residents who’d been hospitalized for the coronavirus , he barred them from testing the residents to see if they were still infected
G01024	 Given how Cuomo’s errors contributed to New York’s catastrophe, it’s hard to say how much credit he deserves for eventually rising to the occasion	against	 Still, by the time New York’s cases got to where Arizona’s are now, he at least understood that the state faced calamity and imposed the lockdown that helped bring it back from the abyss
G01025	 The paranoia and resentment that have long been part of the culture of the modern right are now directed at those warning about the ongoing dangers of the pandemic	in favor of	 Across the country, public health workers have faced death threats, harassment and armed protesters at their homes
G01026	There are many knowable parameters in the equation:	in favor of	your health; the prevalence of cases where you live; the safety precautions being taken any place you want to visit. But the final answer may depend on your individual risk tolerance for exposure to infectious disease.
G01027	So our fear is enormous, and our risk tolerance for exposure is just about zero.	in favor of	In a world of effective antibiotics and antivirals and other treatments, deaths or even serious illnesses from infectious disease seem nearly incomprehensible.
G01028	I hear too many people saying “I’m not going back to life until there’s a vaccine” — as if that will immediately eliminate the risk. It won’t.	in favor of	Even if one of the current vaccine candidates works, it could be quite a while before it’s widely distributed. And to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it has to protect only half of the people who take it from infection.
G01029	So if we want to get out of our bunkers, we all need to take stock of our risk tolerance.	in favor of	For the foreseeable future we will be living in a world with some level of coronavirus out there.
G01030	Some, of course, never got to make this decision.	in favor of	Risk tolerance is about duty and conscience but very often it’s also about how much you need a paycheck.
G01031	Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced.	in favor of	Now many physicians I know in Covid-19 hot spots say they actually feel safest in the hospital, where procedures like masking and sanitizing are assiduously followed. (Hell hath no fury like a surgeon who witnesses a medical student touch a sterile surface with an unsterile hand.) In contrast, on the sidewalk, the coronavirus could be roaming free if people aren’t wearing masks.
G01032	Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced.	in favor of	It’s not just about your individual risk tolerance, but about keeping everyone safe
G01033	I do not blame teachers for being unwilling to return to school in places where administrators and local officials have been in denial about Covid-19 or have been unwilling or unable to do this preparatory work.	against	But once schools have put in place appropriate science-based steps, most teachers (those not in high-risk groups) should return to their jobs.
G01034	I am, in theory, the last person who should ever do any medical trial at all, and, on the way up to the hospital, this thought occurred to me numerous times.	in favor of	As someone who suffers from pretty significant anxiety about my health
G01035	Smart people are worried about this vaccine.	in favor of	I texted one of my friends, an extremely smart, Ivy League-educated doctor. He responded with reservations about taking the vaccine at such an early stage. He said he himself wouldn’t. He was not the first person to express this sentiment. Many people around me told me I was nuts for doing this. They look at me in bewilderment. These people weren’t anti-vaxxers; they don’t belong to dubious Facebook groups. They are educated, often left-leaning — people who shouldn’t, theoretically, have vaccine hesitancy.
G01036	As President Trump pushes for the quick rollout, public trust is eroding.	in favor of	Only 21 percent of Americans surveyed in a CBS poll this month said they would get the vaccine as soon as possible if one was offered at no cost.
G01037	It’s not hard to see where this is heading: a nightmare in which we have a vaccine yet mistrust of the government is so great that people won’t take it.	in favor of	Three in four Democrats say if a vaccine were to become available this year, their first thought would be that it was rushed without enough testing, CBS reported.
G01038	if Americans take the chance and stick their arms out for science. Ask not what your country can do for you but what vaccine trial you can enroll in.	in favor of	Normal will come back a lot faster
G01039	A catastrophic sequence of decisions has blocked states from responding to the pandemic.	in favor of	Alongside growing controversy over judicial nominations, court reform and Covid-19 policies, American law is in the midst of a little-noticed paradigm shift in courts’ treatment of public health measures. The Republican Party’s campaign to take over the federal and state courts is quietly upending a long and deeply embedded tradition of upholding vital public health regulations.
G01040	Today, however, the tradition of salus populi is in collapse.	in favor of	In state and federal courts alike, Republican-appointed and Republican-elected judges are upsetting the long-established consensus.
G01041	The health care of millions could be cast into question even as the pandemic rages.	in favor of	Next month, the court is scheduled to hear arguments on a startling and widely criticized decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas last year that offers yet another opportunity to strike down the Affordable Care Act.
G01042	All of this is a sharp departure from a long history of judicial solicitude toward state powers during epidemics.	in favor of	In the past, when epidemics have threatened white Americans and those with political clout, courts found ways to uphold broad state powers.
G01043	“It’s a reasonable bet, but still a gamble that protection for two or three months is similar to six months or a year,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the Food and Drug Administration panel that is likely to review the vaccine for approval in December.	in favor of	Normally, vaccines aren’t licensed until they show they can protect for a year or two.
G01044	scientists will have to keep an eye out for rare effects such as immune enhancement, a severe illness brought on by a virus’s interaction with immune particles in some vaccinated persons, said Dr. Walt Orenstein, a professor of medicine at Emory University and former director of the immunization program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.	against	To date, no serious side effects have been revealed, and most tend to occur within six weeks of a vaccination.
G01045	It’s possible that vaccines under development by Novavax and Sanofi, which are likely to begin late-phase clinical trials later this year, may be better for the elderly, Dr. Offit noted.	in favor of	Those vaccines contain immune-stimulating particles like the ones contained in the Shingrix vaccine, which is highly effective in protecting older people against shingles disease.
G01046	Can it be rolled out effectively?	in favor of	The Pfizer vaccine, unlike others in late-stage testing, must be kept supercooled, on dry ice around 100 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, from the time it is produced until a few days before it is injected. mRNA quickly self-destructs at higher temperatures.
G01047	Could a premature announcement hurt future vaccines?	in favor of	But if the F.D.A. approves it quickly, that could make it harder for manufacturers of other vaccines to carry out their studies.
G01048	But if the F.D.A. approves it quickly, that could make it harder for manufacturers of other vaccines to carry out their studies.	in favor of	If people are aware that an effective vaccine exists, they may decline to enter clinical trials, partly out of concern they could get a placebo and remain unprotected.
G01049	so it’s crucial to continue additional studies.	in favor of	Many vaccines will be needed in order to meet global demand for protection against Covid-19,
G01050	But it’s difficult to build such road maps.	in favor of	Scientists have never established correlates of immunity for pertussis, for example, although vaccines have been used against those bacteria for nearly a century.
G01051	Still, this is good news, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former F.D.A. deputy commissioner.	in favor of	He said: “I hope this makes people realize that we’re not stuck in this situation forever. There’s hope coming, whether it’s this vaccine or another.”
G01052	When hospital administrators and politicians’ spouses get immunized before people more at risk, it undermines confidence in the system.	in favor of	For weeks Americans have watched those who are well connected, wealthy or crafty “jump the line” to get a vaccine, while others are stuck, endlessly waiting on hold to get an appointment, watching sign-up websites crash or loitering outside clinics in the often-futile hope of getting a shot.
G01053	To eliminate this knock-out-your-neighbor race to score a vaccine, the administration needs to find ways to build trust in the system. It will take more than “more people, more places, more supply” to end the Darwinian competition and restore confidence and order.	in favor of	That’s in part because, desperate to end their own pandemic nightmare, many of our most respected institutions and politicians have behaved badly.
G01054	Of course hospitals have performed heroics during the pandemic —	in favor of	turning orthopedic wards into Covid intensive care units, canceling elective surgeries, bringing retired health care workers back to help, all the while losing thousands of staff members to the virus.
G01055	Of course hospitals have performed heroics during the pandemic — turning orthopedic wards into Covid intensive care units, canceling elective surgeries, bringing retired health care workers back to help, all the while losing thousands of staff members to the virus.	against	But some also have behaved selfishly during the vaccine rollout.
G01056	But some also have behaved selfishly during the vaccine rollout.	in favor of	But many hospitals interpreted the recommendation broadly, inoculating their entire staff — public relations departments, administrators, programmers, laboratory scientists and, sometimes, their boards. They offered vaccines to psychiatrists who were seeing their patients on Zoom. They vaccinated radiologists who were reading films at home.
G01057	Pity the rule-followers:	in favor of	Many older Americans who are not tech-savvy or lack internet access have been unable to get slots. It might be theoretically possible to sign up by phone, but by the time you get through, the newly released appointments may be gone. Those without a child or grandchild to help secure an appointment could be out of luck.
G01058	I don’t blame the lucky recipients;	in favor of	after all, hospitals would just offer the unused vaccine to the next person on the list.
G01059	Now, the new administration is coordinating with states to set up more mass vaccination sites. That’s great.	against	But the United States has allowed its public health system to become a hollowed-out underfunded mess, and many vaccination clinics are being run and staffed by contracted private companies. And the private sector has so far proved too vulnerable to private favoritism.
G01060	The era of the Antonine Plague offers a reminder of what a powerful force nature has been throughout human history.	in favor of	The disease revealed and amplified social tensions that had festered under the surface and brought back whispers of civil war. The people could stand no more, and even the fainthearted Senate at last showed hopeful signs of courage.
G01061	it can seem a bit uncouth to tap into our training to treat Rome as a mirror of our own times.	against	But there is a serious side to these parallels, too:
G01062	But there is a serious side to these parallels, too:	in favor of	The way we understand the past inevitably shapes how we understand the present.
G01063	What we can learn from reflecting on this chapter of ancient Rome is not so much an example to follow or neatly packaged solutions for our own crises, but a different sensibility, an awareness of what a powerful force nature has been throughout human history.	in favor of	The way we understand the past inevitably shapes how we understand the present.
G01064	The result is that even the most turned-over pages still tell us things we had not expected.	in favor of	We inevitably bring our own anxieties and sensibilities to the study of the past.
G01065	A second lesson is that human health and animal health are inseparable.	in favor of	Our relationship with the environment reverberates back upon us, sometimes with destructive force.
G01066	Living through a pandemic not only causes us to see different layers of the past, but can also inspire us to listen to our ancient sources more empathetically.	in favor of	For instance, Covid-19 has made the psychological import of daily death tolls in our ancient texts — such as the 2,000 per day that died in Rome under Commodus — far more real and vivid than ever before.
G01067	One of the hardest paradoxes to reckon with, though, is that the Antonine Plague was as much a symptom of the empire’s success as its sins or stresses.	in favor of	Rome was struck at its apex of power and prosperity — precisely because that power and prosperity had made it ecologically more likely that such a microbiological challenge would emerge and disseminate.
G01068	A sense of our fragility should not make us fatalistic. Rather, it should inspire us to be less complacent.	in favor of	Even with all the tools of modern biological science, we could not have predicted exactly when and where a new pandemic would emerge.
G01069	Even with all the tools of modern biological science, we could not have predicted exactly when and where a new pandemic would emerge.	against	But we were warned, and those warnings went unheeded, in part because we told stories about ourselves implying that we had been freed from nature, that we were immune from the patterns of the past.
G01070	It is a lesson we would do well to heed.	in favor of	The Antonine Plague wasn’t the last lethal pandemic the Romans faced. And Covid-19 won’t be ours.
G01071	vaccination passes will not end the spread of Covid-19.	in favor of	Until coronavirus vaccines are distributed equitably and nations agree to immunization standards,
G01072	Mandating vaccine passports for international travel introduces several challenges.	in favor of	International law allows countries to require visitors to prove they have been vaccinated against diseases like yellow fever. But coronavirus vaccines are new, and they haven’t all been authorized for use throughout the world.
G01073	These systems must also prevent countries from arbitrarily refusing to accept certificates.	in favor of	Without international consensus, we risk entrenching geopolitical divides with inconsistent requirements that could prolong the pandemic. Vaccine passports that enable citizens of some nations to travel internationally while millions of others wait for vaccinations will serve only to deepen global inequities.
G01074	And an American plan would present a number of issues.	in favor of	First, the vaccine rollout in the United States has been plagued by inequities: Black and Latino people are being vaccinated at much lower rates than white people. Second, not everyone can get vaccinated: The shots haven’t been approved for children, and the data on the safety of vaccinations during pregnancy is limited. Vaccination passes will need a mechanism to ensure that people who can’t get the shots aren’t denied jobs, services or education.
G01075	A requirement by employers and businesses of proof of vaccination would carry not only ethical and legal hurdles, but also logistical challenges surrounding how that data is collected, stored, verified and protected.	in favor of	Businesses that require vaccinations for customers or employees will need systems for reviewing vaccine passports, which could create a significant financial burden for struggling businesses. While schools and health care providers have long required and tracked certain immunizations, many companies have never needed to contend with vaccine requirements. If vaccine passports come in the form of a smartphone app, some people won’t be able to use them. And, of course, since a vaccine passport records private health data, a failure to protect this information would create large risk of fraud, counterfeiting, discrimination and privacy violations.
G01076	Of all the barriers to Covid-19 vaccination, fear of needles may seem trivial to overcome.	against	But millions of American adults, not to mention children, still need to be injected to keep themselves and their communities safe. And it’s likely some of them aren’t doing so in part because they fear or just don’t like needles.
G01077	This is a substantial public health problem,	in favor of	because a body of research shows that around one in 10 adults are so afraid of needles that they will delay or avoid vaccinations.
G01078	High levels of needle fear, with or without a diagnosis, can affect vaccination programs.	in favor of	Some people might avoid getting vaccinated altogether, and others might endure it under immense distress, putting them at risk for what experts call immunization stress-related responses such as feeling dizzy or fainting during an injection.
G01079	Organizers of vaccination programs have important roles to play in setting up their vaccination sites to minimize needle fears and immunization stress-related responses.	in favor of	Strategies like organizing one-way clinic flow with privacy options help avoid long lines and having people being injected “on display” for others waiting. And it doesn’t start and end at the vaccination site — people working to promote vaccines should keep needle fears in mind and consider positive and neutral images that don’t show the needles themselves.
G01080	Exposure-based therapy is recommended.	in favor of	People at the high end of the needle fear spectrum will most likely need another approach to manage that fear first rather than get a vaccination while extremely frightened.
